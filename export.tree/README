## Description
We scanned an independent cohort of participants under three conditions:  (1) Fasting:  following their standard diet, with an overnight fast (both sessions, run-1); (2) Glucose Bolus:  breaking the fast with a glucose drink (Glucose Tolerance Test Beverages, Fisher Scientific, Inc.; Hampton NH) (ses-glc_run-2); and (3) D-βHb Ketone Ester Bolus: breaking the fast with a ketone drink (D-β-hydroxybutyrate ketone ester; HVMN, San Francisco CA) (ses-bhb_run-2). The D-βHb ketone ester was weight-dosed for each participant at 395mg/kg. Task involved resting state (task-rest) and tetris (task-task). Tetris task is available only for subjects starting with sub-023.
